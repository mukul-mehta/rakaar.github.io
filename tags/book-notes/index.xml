While reading, I occasionally take down notes in evernote. But they are mostly irregualar and unstructured. I just made notes of points, which I felt important or liked exteremely. Going through this will only give you a rough idea of what&amp;rsquo;s inside the book. At many places, I have not changed the lines from the book, so as to not reduce the impact!</description></item></channel></rss>
