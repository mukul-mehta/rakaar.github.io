As holidays have come, there is a too much free time in hand. I am afraid that it might get wasted in useless things like spending too much time on YouTube, getting lost in random thoughts(generally happens during the college days). At the same time, I got to know about the fact that for a day, a human mind thinks of around 50,000 conscious thoughts. I still don&rsquo;t trust the fact though!&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2020-11-28-restart-blogging/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2020-07-28-killing-with-1-line/>Killing process with one command, which is still utilizing the port</a></h1><time>Jul 28, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Killing the process It happens regularly that when you stop the process(in my case mostly a node server or flask server) and restart in the same terminal session. It gives the error saying PORT is still in use. In that case, using ps aux and grep, you find the process id, and kill it. In this stackoverflow answer by Hamid Tavakoli. This simple one line does it for you
1 kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '\snode\s' | awk '{print $2}') the above serves as an example for killing an node js process, which is still utilizing the port.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2020-07-28-killing-with-1-line/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2020-07-12-automate-deploy/>Automate deployment on an EC2 instance using Github Webhooks</a></h1><time>Jul 12, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Credits This article have been mainly inspired by the project -Midgard. Thanks to Pankaj Kumar with whom I setup this Continuous deployment. I am a newbie in this field of deployment. If any mistakes, please do provide a feedback. Also thanks to Shubham Mishra for helping us in the process.
Problem Statement There is a repository on github and you have an EC2 instance(or any instance provided by an IaaS). On every push to certain branch, you want the code in the instance to be updated.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2020-07-12-automate-deploy/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2020-06-21-web-server-and-application-server/>What is difference between nginx and react server</a></h1><time>Jun 21, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Background Once Pankaj Kumar expressed, &ldquo;What exactly does nginx do?Is it even necessary? How is it different from react server that starts when you run npm run start in the terminal&rdquo;. Though I have used both of them in the past, I couldn&rsquo;t exactly answer his question. It is at these moments that you realize that your knowledge is fragile and you don&rsquo;t have a proper understanding of things. I tried some googling and went through few pages, this was really helpful.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2020-06-21-web-server-and-application-server/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2020-05-30-zero-to-one-notes/>Zero to One notes</a></h1><time>May 30, 2020</time><br><div class=description>Disclaimer This is not a book summary. While reading, I occasionally take down notes in evernote. But they are mostly irregualar and unstructured. I just made notes of points, which I felt important or liked exteremely. Going through this will only give you a rough idea of what&rsquo;s inside the book. At many places, I have not changed the lines from the book, so as to not reduce the impact!&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2020-05-30-zero-to-one-notes/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"><a href=/page/3/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>← Prev</span></a></span>
