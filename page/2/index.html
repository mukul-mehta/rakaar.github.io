The response obtained is a string and it needs to parsed, which was kind of frustrating process(it is really smooth in other languages like JS and Python). Many sources suggest to define a struct and Parse, which is actually a good way. But I wish to write less for sake of simplicity. So in this post, I attempt to parse the different cases of JSON response with less lines of code, though it is not a recommended way!&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-04-23-go-json-res-parse/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh/>On what to laugh?</a></h1><time>Apr 18, 2021</time><br><div class=description>It happened to me several times, that I share a funny joke(funny according to me) with my friends and they get offended. This makes me feel guilty. Since, then I always used to wonder if there is any framework to decide if a joke is funny for everyone. When things like space and time are relative, how can you decide if something is funny or not absolutely?
But after reflecting on this, I came up with a small framework to decide if something is to be considered as a joke or taken seriously.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-03-16-man-meaning/>Favourite ideas from the book - Man's search for meaning by Victor Frankl</a></h1><time>Mar 16, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Man&rsquo;s search for meaning is a book by Victor Frankl, a holocaust survivor. Victor Frankl developed the concept of Logotherapy, in which neurosis(mental disorder involving stress) is treated by helping patient to find a meaning in his/her life, to live by. The first half of the book contains Author&rsquo;s experiences and events in Auschwitz Concentration Camp. The author being a doctor, gives a psychological take on the events. Among these lines, there are many valuable and interesting ideas, and I wish to write a subset of them below.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-03-16-man-meaning/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-03-01-einstein-book/>Why you should read Einstein-His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson</a></h1><time>Mar 1, 2021</time><br><div class=description>To summarize, it is one heck of a story, of how a simple patent clerk revolutionizes the way we think about world.
Why Einstein is a big deal: Einstein is a household name. During his era, he was treated as a Rockstar! He was undoubtedly most popular living physicist during his time. He was even offered the presidency of Israel, which he denied. After reading this book, you will really know what makes him so important.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-03-01-einstein-book/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-02-27-2020-books/>Favourite ideas from Books that I read in 2020</a></h1><time>Feb 27, 2021</time><br><div class=description>When I learn about a new interesting idea present in a book, I read the book to explore the idea deeply and explore similar concepts and other ideas in the vicinity. In each book, there are some certain points which stay in my mind for a longer time and I try to put them into practice. In this blog, I wish to explain such ideas from the books that I have read in 2020.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-02-27-2020-books/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"><a href=/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>← Prev</span></a></span>
