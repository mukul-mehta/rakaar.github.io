On the activism side, he played a major role in preventing the Online Privacy act through SOPA. I have just mentioned the key points, to really know and understand Aaron&rsquo;s Legacy, I highly recommend you to watch this documentary - The Internet&rsquo;s own Child: The Story of Aaron Swartz. Aaron used to blog regularly on his site.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-05-20-types-yt/>Types of Science YouTubers</a></h1><time>May 20, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Over the last 8 months, I have been exploring Physics. And I have explored and learnt most of the things from YouTube videos. The topics include Linear Algebra, basics of Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and many more. I was greatly amazed by the way YouTubers deliver the content, and how most of the learning becomes fun. The enthusiasm of fellow learners is reflected in the comment section of the videos and in sub-reddit posts.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-05-20-types-yt/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground/>I read Notes from Underground</a></h1><time>May 14, 2021</time><br><div class=description>I recently read Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky. This is the second book I read of Dostoevsky. Crime and Punishment was my first. This is surprisingly a small around 120 page book, but contains a lot of practical philosophy, which I admit that I couldn&rsquo;t grasp on my own when I read it. YouTube reviews on the book helped me understand things that I missed when I read it first. Nevertheless, there are some good things which I learned from the book.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-04-23-go-json-res-parse/>Parsing HTTP response in Golang</a></h1><time>Apr 23, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Recently, while writing some code in Golang, I had to make HTTP requests and use the response. The response obtained is a string and it needs to parsed, which was kind of frustrating process(it is really smooth in other languages like JS and Python). Many sources suggest to define a struct and Parse, which is actually a good way. But I wish to write less for sake of simplicity. So in this post, I attempt to parse the different cases of JSON response with less lines of code, though it is not a recommended way!&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-04-23-go-json-res-parse/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh/>On what to laugh?</a></h1><time>Apr 18, 2021</time><br><div class=description>It happened to me several times, that I share a funny joke(funny according to me) with my friends and they get offended. This makes me feel guilty. Since, then I always used to wonder if there is any framework to decide if a joke is funny for everyone. When things like space and time are relative, how can you decide if something is funny or not absolutely?
But after reflecting on this, I came up with a small framework to decide if something is to be considered as a joke or taken seriously.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"><a href=/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>← Prev</span></a></span>
