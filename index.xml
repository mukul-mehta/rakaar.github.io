The current world that we see around proves the fact. We have built machines that help us communicate from one end of the world within seconds, do all sorts of other complex activities like Mathematics, literature, finding out the origin of universe and so on.
Yet, there is one simple thing that we humans have great difficulty in doing it when compared to animals.</description></item><item><title>Ignoring extra words in MeiliSearch v0.20</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-21-meilisearchfail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-21-meilisearchfail/</guid><description>MeiliSearch is a search API, which is super easy to setup and has some amazing features like being typo tolerant, handling synonyms, highlighting, multi language support and more. Setting up MeiliSearch and working with it as a developer has been a smooth experience. The documentation is also well written.
But there is one problem! MeiliSearch fails to return when there is an extra useless word. For example, here is a Crates browser demo of MeiliSearch which searches through Rust crates.</description></item><item><title>Summaries of Aaron Swartz's selected blogs</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/</guid><description>Aaron Swartz was a young hacktivist, who is popular for co-creating RSS, Reddit, CC license.

And I have explored and learnt most of the things from YouTube videos. The topics include Linear Algebra, basics of Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and many more. I was greatly amazed by the way YouTubers deliver the content, and how most of the learning becomes fun. The enthusiasm of fellow learners is reflected in the comment section of the videos and in sub-reddit posts.</description></item><item><title>I read Notes from Underground</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground/</guid><description>I recently read Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky. This is the second book I read of Dostoevsky. Crime and Punishment was my first. This is surprisingly a small around 120 page book, but contains a lot of practical philosophy, which I admit that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t grasp on my own when I read it. YouTube reviews on the book helped me understand things that I missed when I read it first. Nevertheless, there are some good things which I learned from the book.</description></item><item><title>Parsing HTTP response in Golang</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-04-23-go-json-res-parse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-04-23-go-json-res-parse/</guid><description>Recently, while writing some code in Golang, I had to make HTTP requests and use the response. The response obtained is a string and it needs to parsed, which was kind of frustrating process(it is really smooth in other languages like JS and Python). Many sources suggest to define a struct and Parse, which is actually a good way. But I wish to write less for sake of simplicity. So in this post, I attempt to parse the different cases of JSON response with less lines of code, though it is not a recommended way!</description></item><item><title>On what to laugh?</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-04-18-on-what-2-laugh/</guid><description>It happened to me several times, that I share a funny joke(funny according to me) with my friends and they get offended. This makes me feel guilty. Since, then I always used to wonder if there is any framework to decide if a joke is funny for everyone. When things like space and time are relative, how can you decide if something is funny or not absolutely?
But after reflecting on this, I came up with a small framework to decide if something is to be considered as a joke or taken seriously.</description></item><item><title>Favourite ideas from the book - Man's search for meaning by Victor Frankl</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-03-16-man-meaning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-03-16-man-meaning/</guid><description>Man&amp;rsquo;s search for meaning is a book by Victor Frankl, a holocaust survivor. Victor Frankl developed the concept of Logotherapy, in which neurosis(mental disorder involving stress) is treated by helping patient to find a meaning in his/her life, to live by. The first half of the book contains Author&amp;rsquo;s experiences and events in Auschwitz Concentration Camp. The author being a doctor, gives a psychological take on the events. Among these lines, there are many valuable and interesting ideas, and I wish to write a subset of them below.</description></item><item><title>Why you should read Einstein-His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-03-01-einstein-book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-03-01-einstein-book/</guid><description>To summarize, it is one heck of a story, of how a simple patent clerk revolutionizes the way we think about world.
Why Einstein is a big deal: Einstein is a household name. During his era, he was treated as a Rockstar! He was undoubtedly most popular living physicist during his time. He was even offered the presidency of Israel, which he denied.

In this blog, I wish to explain a sophisticated argument on why DH&amp;rsquo;s writings are dense, and why I feel they should be. Of course, a simple explanation can be made that he tries explaining the example in great detail so that less informed people also understand.</description></item><item><title>Measuring only m qubits out of n regiters in Qiskit</title><link>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-02-12-measure-m-outof-n/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-02-12-measure-m-outof-n/</guid><description>Suppose you have declared n registers in your circuit, but at the end you want to measure only m qubits.

Open in the sense, any individual can join the network, read , write and even verify the transactions. Also all the transactions that had happened in the blockchain would be visible to everyone in the network.
