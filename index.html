The current world that we see around proves the fact. We have built machines that help us communicate from one end of the world within seconds, do all sorts of other complex activities like Mathematics, literature, finding out the origin of universe and so on.
Yet, there is one simple thing that we humans have great difficulty in doing it when compared to animals.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-06-25-meaninglessness/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-06-21-meilisearchfail/>Ignoring extra words in MeiliSearch v0.20</a></h1><time>Jun 21, 2021</time><br><div class=description>MeiliSearch is a search API, which is super easy to setup and has some amazing features like being typo tolerant, handling synonyms, highlighting, multi language support and more. Setting up MeiliSearch and working with it as a developer has been a smooth experience. The documentation is also well written.
But there is one problem! MeiliSearch fails to return when there is an extra useless word. For example, here is a Crates browser demo of MeiliSearch which searches through Rust crates.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-06-21-meilisearchfail/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/>Summaries of Aaron Swartz's selected blogs</a></h1><time>Jun 11, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Aaron Swartz was a young hacktivist, who is popular for co-creating RSS, Reddit, CC license. On the activism side, he played a major role in preventing the Online Privacy act through SOPA. I have just mentioned the key points, to really know and understand Aaron&rsquo;s Legacy, I highly recommend you to watch this documentary - The Internet&rsquo;s own Child: The Story of Aaron Swartz. Aaron used to blog regularly on his site.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-05-20-types-yt/>Types of Science YouTubers</a></h1><time>May 20, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Over the last 8 months, I have been exploring Physics. And I have explored and learnt most of the things from YouTube videos. The topics include Linear Algebra, basics of Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and many more. I was greatly amazed by the way YouTubers deliver the content, and how most of the learning becomes fun. The enthusiasm of fellow learners is reflected in the comment section of the videos and in sub-reddit posts.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-05-20-types-yt/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground/>I read Notes from Underground</a></h1><time>May 14, 2021</time><br><div class=description>I recently read Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky. This is the second book I read of Dostoevsky. Crime and Punishment was my first. This is surprisingly a small around 120 page book, but contains a lot of practical philosophy, which I admit that I couldn&rsquo;t grasp on my own when I read it. YouTube reviews on the book helped me understand things that I missed when I read it first. Nevertheless, there are some good things which I learned from the book.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/2021-05-14-on-notes-from-underground/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"></span><span class="page-item page-next"><a href=/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>Next →</span></a></span></ul></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://rakaar.github.io/index.xml title=RSS><i data-feather=rss></i></a>|<a class=soc href=mailto:rka87338@gmail.com title=Email><i data-feather=mail></i></a>|<a class=soc href=https://github.com/rakaar title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>|<a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/raghavendrakau9 title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a>|⚡️
